# What is KyrixJs?

KyrixJs is a streamlined full-stack solution designed for developers who want the performance and simplicity of a client-side React app, with the added SEO advantages of a server-rendered site. It combines the flexibility of CSR (Client-Side Rendering) with smart SEO enhancements, ensuring your web apps rank better in search engines without compromising speed or complexity.

## Key Features

- **SEO Boost**: Kyrix injects dynamic metadata into the HTML before it’s served, giving your app significant SEO benefits without requiring full server-side rendering.
- **End-to-End TypeSafety**: With type definitions shared between the front end and back end, you no longer need to duplicate logic. Any changes made on the server side are automatically reflected on the client, keeping your application in sync without extra effort.
- **Fast & Lightweight**: Built with Vite, Kyrix ensures fast build times and blazing performance, keeping your app lightweight and responsive.
- **Familiar React Experience**: No steep learning curve—Kyrix sticks with standard React practices and client-side rendering, making it easy to integrate with existing projects.
- **Pre-Configured Bundles**: With pre-built configurations for databases, CSS frameworks, and essential tooling, which saves you time on setup and gets your project running quickly.
- **Ideal for Modern Web Apps**: Perfect for web applications, yet flexible enough for blogs and documentation, it delivers the best of both worlds—speed and SEO.

## Use Cases

1. **Multi-Page Applications (MPAs) with SEO Benefits**:
