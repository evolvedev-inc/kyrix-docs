This data is embedded directly into the HTML, so when the client renders the page, both the metadata and initial data are immediately available, eliminating the need for extra data-fetching requests on the client side.</p><p>In this setup, Kyrix Router acts as a <strong>tRPC router</strong> that gets called on every page request in the server. It allows you to inject page-specific metadata (like titles, descriptions, etc.) as well as the initial data necessary to render the page. This improves performance by reducing the number of client-side data fetching calls, similar to what is common in SSR (Server-Side Rendering) frameworks.</p><p>When a page is requested:</p><ol><li><strong>Kyrix Router</strong> processes the request.</li><li>Metadata and initial data are fetched on the server.</li><li>Both are injected into the HTML template.</li><li>When the page loads on the client, it can use this preloaded data and metadata without making additional requests.</li><li>This data gets cached via <strong>React Query</strong> in client.</li></ol><p>This approach enhances the <strong>initial page load time</strong> and ensures that SEO-critical metadata is already part of the HTML response, making it especially useful for applications where fast and accurate data and <strong>SEO</strong> is crucial.</p>',6)]))}const g=t(s,[["render",n]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
